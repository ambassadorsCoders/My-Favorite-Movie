<h1>Inside Out 2</h1>
        <h2>a story about universal truths that almost everyone has experienced, 
            and it's expressed well, and in a unique way.</h2>
    <hr>
<h1>deadpool and wolverine</h1>
        <h2>It was a lot of fun, but I think the weakest in the series. The story made no sense, 
            and the resolution of the story goes against the rules of the universe they set up.</h2>
    <hr>
<h1>A QUIET PLACE</h1>
        <h2>Honestly I give a lot of bonus points to the movie for killing main characters, such as the young boy and the father. It really helps sell that this is serious and no one is safe. 
            Although it doesn't quite feel like horror as much as "dread", similar to those survival movies where a plane crashes and you spend most of the movie knowing that only some of the people make it out alive.</h2>
